“Have the help!”

The words erupting from an annoyed and confused James Harden were loud and clear, even from the socially distanced bench.

“Have the help!”

The Rockets’ final regular-season game might not have been the game to draw concrete conclusions from, especially given how the majority of teams used it to rest their starters before the postseason, but Harden wasn’t particularly pleased with the effort he was seeing. The 76ers’ Frank Kormaz had just picked up the loose ball on one end, dribbled the length of the floor and pulled up for an uncontested 3 on the left wing.

There had been a miscommunication between the team getting back in transition — the cardinal sin within Houston’s organization — and the Rockets had forgotten the No. 1 rule of transition defense: pick up the ball first.

Such a simple phrase uttered in the course of a basketball game might not have carried weight had this been another month or another season. You could even make the argument that Harden doesn’t say that five years ago, three years ago or even last season. But his words and the tone by which he conveyed them displayed a few things that evening — a renewed commitment to defense, a realization of the urgency of the coming playoffs and another wrinkle in his maturation and leadership.

“去帮忙！”

即使是从保持社交距离的替补席上发出来，哈登愤怒且困惑的话语依旧嘹亮和清晰。

“去帮忙！”

火箭最后一场常规赛可能并不适合用来下结论，尤其是考虑到大部分球队是用来在季后赛前休息首发的，但是哈登依旧对他看到的努力程度感到不满。76人的科尔克马兹刚刚从球场一段捡起了掉落的球，运过了全场，在左翼投出了一个无干扰三分。

这是一直都是球队防转换时的沟通不畅——火箭团队内的最大问题——火箭总会忘记防转换第一重要的规则：先接管球。

如果这是另一个月或者另一个赛季，这些话语可能不会这么有分量。你甚至可以说哈登五个赛季前、三个赛季前甚至上个赛季都不会说出这样的话。但是那个夜晚他的话语和语气传达出了一些东西——对防守的重新承诺，意识到了即将到来的季后赛的紧迫性以及展现了他的成熟和领导力。

Heading into Game 1 of the first round, aside from the obvious storylines surrounding the Rockets-Thunder matchup — the relationship (or lack thereof) between Chris Paul and James Harden being the most prominent — the most important thing for Houston was seeking validation for the small-ball groundwork they had laid over the past months leading up to and including the restarted season.

One of the oft-discussed traits of postseason basketball is the notion that regular-season trends don’t carry over. You’ve heard the accompanying phrases before: the games slow down, the games get tougher.

For a team that takes and makes as many 3s as the Rockets do, a hot shooting trend might not have mattered much to them. If Game 7 of a certain Western Conference finals serves as a reminder, your biggest asset can abandon you at the worst possible time.

Small ball enhanced the available space the team had to operate with, prompting a reliance on Harden and Russell Westbrook to create such looks for their teammates, but offensive efficiency alone wouldn’t get Houston where it wanted to be.

For the Rockets to reach the heights they’ve dreamed of, the reason they decided to play this crazy game in the first place, their defense would have to match.

进入首轮首战，保罗和哈登之间的关系（或者说缺乏关系）是最显著的，除此以外就是火雷对位了。对于休斯顿而言最终的是寻找验证过去几个月包括复赛期间的小球有效性。

季后赛通常会被认为有这一特征：常规赛的趋势不会被延续。你也会听过这样的话：比赛会变慢，对抗会更激烈。

对于一支像火箭一样投进那么多三分的球队来说，火热的投射趋势并不重要。如果你还记得西决第七场，你最大的财富很可能会在最糟糕的时候离开你。

小球进一步提高了球队的空间情况，让哈登和威少能给队友创造更好的空位，但是仅仅靠进攻效率无法让休斯顿到达他想要去的地方。

为了火箭想达到的梦寐以求的高度，他们的防守必须与之匹配，这是他们决定在这场疯狂的比赛中放在首位的。

“It’s about every possession, personnel, knowing guys’ tendencies, and going out there and executing,” Harden said Monday.

In the bubble and during the restart games, there was a considerable paradigm shift in the defensive realm. Film sessions before practice were longer and more direct. Communication increased tenfold. Their mantra evolved from “shrink the floor” to “be scrappy”. Houston ranked second amongst the 22 teams in Orlando in defensive efficiency, but it didn’t just look like a flash in the pan. There was tangible evidence that this team was turning a corner, moving from a team that occasionally got stops to one that was a legit lockdown threat.

Defense, unlike shooting, is a trend that travels well. After all, although a chunk of defense comes down to God-given talents like size, speed, and length, a big section is dedicated to the intangibles. Effort. Commitment. Communication. Repetition.

The unique nature of this season—a four-month layoff and subsequent restart period—meant that the state that teams were in was just that. Three or four days from the ending of the season to the start of the postseason wouldn’t change that—there’s no magical “switch” that you often hear about in regards to teams and heightened circumstances, such as the playoffs. It’s why you’ve seen hungry teams like Denver and Portland win and contenders like the Bucks and the Lakers lose. Not that those teams won’t go on to win the series, because they should, but there’s an unwritten section in the box score for effort.

The Rockets knew the Thunder would come out swinging. Not only is that in their nature as a top ten defensive unit, but without Westbrook, Houston’s threat would be considerably weakened—at least conventional thinking would indicate as much.

哈登周一说：“这涉及到没一个回合，每一个人，要知道没一个人的动向，跟出去执行到位”

在复赛园区和复赛期间，球队再防守领域对防守方式做了巨大的改变。训练前的录像时间更长也更直接。沟通增加了十倍。他们的口头禅从“shrink the floor”演变成了“be scrappy”。休斯顿在22支复赛球队里防守效率排第二，这并不寻常。所有的迹象都在表明球队方向在转变，从偶尔能防住的球队变成锁定型球队。

防守和投篮不同，它会是一种趋势。毕竟防守一部分归功于天赋，像体型、机动性和高度。但是更大程度归功于无形资产，努力程度、交流和不断重复。

这个赛季有他的独特性——四个月的停摆和紧接着的复赛——意味着就会是那时候所处状态的样子。季后赛开始前的三天或者四天不会改变什么。这里很少能听到过去常见的临到季后赛这样重要比赛的魔力变身。这就是为什么你能看到掘金（IKO应该写错了，这里应该是魔术）和开拓者这样饥饿的球队赢了，而争冠热门雄鹿和湖人输了。不是说这些球队因此就应该赢下系列赛，但是有个不成文的规定是努力决定结果。

火箭知道雷霆会造成威胁。不仅仅是因为他们是防守前十的球队，更是因为没有了威少。火箭的威胁大大降低了——至少传统分析上是这么看的。
