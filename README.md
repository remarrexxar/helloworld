“Have the help!”

The words erupting from an annoyed and confused James Harden were loud and clear, even from the socially distanced bench.

“Have the help!”

The Rockets’ final regular-season game might not have been the game to draw concrete conclusions from, especially given how the majority of teams used it to rest their starters before the postseason, but Harden wasn’t particularly pleased with the effort he was seeing. The 76ers’ Frank Kormaz had just picked up the loose ball on one end, dribbled the length of the floor and pulled up for an uncontested 3 on the left wing.

There had been a miscommunication between the team getting back in transition — the cardinal sin within Houston’s organization — and the Rockets had forgotten the No. 1 rule of transition defense: pick up the ball first.

Such a simple phrase uttered in the course of a basketball game might not have carried weight had this been another month or another season. You could even make the argument that Harden doesn’t say that five years ago, three years ago or even last season. But his words and the tone by which he conveyed them displayed a few things that evening — a renewed commitment to defense, a realization of the urgency of the coming playoffs and another wrinkle in his maturation and leadership.

“去帮忙！”

即使是从保持社交距离的替补席上发出来，哈登愤怒且困惑的话语依旧嘹亮和清晰。

“去帮忙！”

火箭最后一场常规赛可能并不适合用来下结论，尤其是考虑到大部分球队是用来在季后赛前休息首发的，但是哈登依旧对他看到的努力程度感到不满。76人的科尔克马兹刚刚从球场一段捡起了掉落的球，运过了全场，在左翼投出了一个无干扰三分。

这是一直都是球队防转换时的沟通不畅——火箭团队内的最大问题——火箭总会忘记防转换第一重要的规则：先接管球。

如果这是另一个月或者另一个赛季，这些话语可能不会这么有分量。你甚至可以说哈登五个赛季前、三个赛季前甚至上个赛季都不会说出这样的话。但是那个夜晚他的话语和语气传达出了一些东西——对防守的重新承诺，意识到了即将到来的季后赛的紧迫性以及展现了他的成熟和领导力。

Heading into Game 1 of the first round, aside from the obvious storylines surrounding the Rockets-Thunder matchup — the relationship (or lack thereof) between Chris Paul and James Harden being the most prominent — the most important thing for Houston was seeking validation for the small-ball groundwork they had laid over the past months leading up to and including the restarted season.

One of the oft-discussed traits of postseason basketball is the notion that regular-season trends don’t carry over. You’ve heard the accompanying phrases before: the games slow down, the games get tougher.

For a team that takes and makes as many 3s as the Rockets do, a hot shooting trend might not have mattered much to them. If Game 7 of a certain Western Conference finals serves as a reminder, your biggest asset can abandon you at the worst possible time.

Small ball enhanced the available space the team had to operate with, prompting a reliance on Harden and Russell Westbrook to create such looks for their teammates, but offensive efficiency alone wouldn’t get Houston where it wanted to be.

For the Rockets to reach the heights they’ve dreamed of, the reason they decided to play this crazy game in the first place, their defense would have to match.

进入首轮首战，保罗和哈登之间的关系（或者说缺乏关系）是最显著的，除此以外就是火雷对位了。对于休斯顿而言最终的是寻找验证过去几个月包括复赛期间的小球有效性。

季后赛通常会被认为有这一特征：常规赛的趋势不会被延续。你也会听过这样的话：比赛会变慢，对抗会更激烈。

对于一支像火箭一样投进那么多三分的球队来说，火热的投射趋势并不重要。如果你还记得西决第七场，你最大的财富很可能会在最糟糕的时候离开你。

小球进一步提高了球队的空间情况，让哈登和威少能给队友创造更好的空位，但是仅仅靠进攻效率无法让休斯顿到达他想要去的地方。

为了火箭想达到的梦寐以求的高度，他们的防守必须与之匹配，这是他们决定在这场疯狂的比赛中放在首位的。

“It’s about every possession, personnel, knowing guys’ tendencies, and going out there and executing,” Harden said Monday.

In the bubble and during the restart games, there was a considerable paradigm shift in the defensive realm. Film sessions before practice were longer and more direct. Communication increased tenfold. Their mantra evolved from “shrink the floor” to “be scrappy”. Houston ranked second amongst the 22 teams in Orlando in defensive efficiency, but it didn’t just look like a flash in the pan. There was tangible evidence that this team was turning a corner, moving from a team that occasionally got stops to one that was a legit lockdown threat.

Defense, unlike shooting, is a trend that travels well. After all, although a chunk of defense comes down to God-given talents like size, speed, and length, a big section is dedicated to the intangibles. Effort. Commitment. Communication. Repetition.

The unique nature of this season—a four-month layoff and subsequent restart period—meant that the state that teams were in was just that. Three or four days from the ending of the season to the start of the postseason wouldn’t change that—there’s no magical “switch” that you often hear about in regards to teams and heightened circumstances, such as the playoffs. It’s why you’ve seen hungry teams like Denver and Portland win and contenders like the Bucks and the Lakers lose. Not that those teams won’t go on to win the series, because they should, but there’s an unwritten section in the box score for effort.

The Rockets knew the Thunder would come out swinging. Not only is that in their nature as a top ten defensive unit, but without Westbrook, Houston’s threat would be considerably weakened—at least conventional thinking would indicate as much.

哈登周一说：“这涉及到没一个回合，每一个人，要知道没一个人的动向，跟出去执行到位”

在复赛园区和复赛期间，球队再防守领域对防守方式做了巨大的改变。训练前的录像时间更长也更直接。沟通增加了十倍。他们的口头禅从“shrink the floor”演变成了“be scrappy”。休斯顿在22支复赛球队里防守效率排第二，这并不寻常。所有的迹象都在表明球队方向在转变，从偶尔能防住的球队变成锁定型球队。

防守和投篮不同，它会是一种趋势。毕竟防守一部分归功于天赋，像体型、机动性和高度。但是更大程度归功于无形资产，努力程度、交流和不断重复。

这个赛季有他的独特性——四个月的停摆和紧接着的复赛——意味着就会是那时候所处状态的样子。季后赛开始前的三天或者四天不会改变什么。这里很少能听到过去常见的临到季后赛这样重要比赛的魔力变身。这就是为什么你能看到掘金（IKO应该写错了，这里应该是魔术）和开拓者这样饥饿的球队赢了，而争冠热门雄鹿和湖人输了。不是说这些球队因此就应该赢下系列赛，但是有个不成文的规定是努力决定结果。

火箭知道雷霆会造成威胁。不仅仅是因为他们是防守前十的球队，更是因为没有了威少。火箭的威胁大大降低了——至少传统分析上是这么看的。

Both teams started the game on the aggressive end. There were slip-and-falls and entanglements early on (leading to a hearty Tucker butt slap on Paul). Harden’s first touch came with a foul within seconds as did Paul’s. Of the first 17 shots that came from both teams, only five were makes. The final score won’t show it, but there were physical battles all over the floor for 48 minutes. This was not an easy game by any means. But the Rockets wanted it more. And more importantly, they did it together.

“Well that’s how we have to play since we’re undersized,” D’Antoni said following Houston’s 123-108 win. “We have to play that way, be flying around. Once we play with that intensity, the speed that we’re playing with makes it tough on teams. Otherwise, they catch you on the ropes and will pound you. I thought the effort was out of sight, obviously some good individual performances but as a team, it was great defense and we didn’t turn the ball over.”

Without a doubt, the most important aspect of Houston’s defensive gameplan was how they would deal with Paul. Aside from the sheer revenge factor, it’s been said that you can’t stop great players. You can simply slow them down. With someone of Paul’s caliber, it would be of uber importance to slow Paul’s imprint on the game down, space out his impact, and slow down his style of play.

What the Rockets had employed against him during the regular season served as an important context but didn’t tell the whole story. In Game 1, the operative word was pressure. When guarding an intelligent player like Paul, it’s important to disrupt the flow he’s accustomed to. That, of course, plays into the hands of what Houston wants to do already, but there was an emphasis from the opening tip.

两支球队都从进攻端开始比赛。开局都大量的摔倒和拉扯（塔克还拍了保罗屁股）。哈登的第一次触球很快就被犯规了，保罗也是一样。两队最初17次投篮只进了5个。最终的比分可能展现不出来，但是两队进行了48分钟的肉搏战。各种程度上说这都不是一场容易的比赛。但是对于火箭来说他们想要更多，也更重要，并且他们最终也做到了。

“这就是我们小型化之后的打球方式”在火箭123-108赢球之后德安东尼说：“我们必须这么大，到处跑。当我们进行这样高强度的比赛时，速度会让我们的对手打得很困难。否则一旦对手找到节奏就会痛击你。我认为努力是很难被直接看到的，显然有一些很好的个人表现，但是作为一个团队，我们打出了很好的防守没有让翻盘发生”

毫无疑问，火箭防守计划最重要的的部分是如何处理保罗。除了单纯的复仇因素，很多人都说你们不能阻止优秀的球员。你可以很简单的降低速度。对于拥有保罗这样才能的球员来说，要降低他的影响力，控制他的作用和放慢他的打法都很重要。

火箭常规赛就采用的对付他的方式很重要但不是全部。在第一场比赛，很有效的一点是施压。当防守像保罗这样聪明的球员时，重要的是破坏他习惯的流程。当然这已经成为火箭已经在做的另一个重点。

If you give Paul too much time, he’ll dice you up from the inside out. He likes to use a snake dribble and has a penchant for keeping defenders “in jail”, a term for shielding himself and keeping pressure behind him. To counter this, the Rockets attacked early and often. Gordon was the primary defender, using his upper body strength to bump and bother constantly. On one occasion in the fourth quarter where the Thunder were attempting a comeback, Gordon denied Paul on successive attempts to attack in isolation, resulting in Paul simply throwing the ball away.

But a task of this magnitude wasn’t a one-man job. Houston hedged softly on Paul screens, a term that means “help lightly and recover”. Every Paul drive was met with a Rocket body, sometimes two or three. Sometimes, fouls were called, others weren’t. But the overriding message was, We’re not going to let you do what you want to do.

“I thought it was good,” Gordon said of the intensity. “We can continue to get better and better. There are a few ways where we can get better for next game. We’re a team that knows what it takes. We’re going to try and make strides to play even better next game.”

Paul eventually finished the game with a near-triple-double (20 points, 10 rebounds, 9 assists) but going back to earlier, it was delayed production. Paul was held without a made field goal for the entire first quarter and didn’t make a layup until 8:44 left in the second. But aside from the individual job on Paul, the most impressive part of Houston’s defense came as a unit.

如果你给保罗太多时间太会内外运球把你的防线切碎。他喜欢像蛇一样运球把防守人带入陷阱，这是一种保护自己也减少压力的方式。为了应对这个火箭很早也经常对他施压。戈登是主要防守人，利用他的上身力量不断对抗干扰保罗。当第四节雷霆尝试反攻的时候，戈登单防住了保罗的单打，逼得保罗丢了球。

但是这样艰巨的任务不是一个人的事。火箭对于保罗的挡拆用了绕防，这个术语的意思是稍微换防延阻然后马上换回来。每次保罗突破都会面对火箭球员的阻拦，有时候是两个或三个。有时候会被吹犯规，其他时间也不会。但是重要的信息室，我们不会让你做你想做的事。

“我认为这很好”戈登谈到了强度：“我们持续变得越来越好有好几种办法能让下场比赛做的很好。我们知道如果去做。我们将努力取得更大的进步，在下场比赛打得更好。”

保罗最终整场比赛拿到了准三双（20分10板9助攻）但是回头看，产出太晚了。整个第一节保罗没有运动战进球，知道第二节还剩8:44秒才完成一次上篮。除了对保罗的个人防守外，火箭防守的最大亮点是打得像一个整体。

The best defenses in the world move with the alacrity and intelligence of a well-lubricated machine. Their uniform activity and presence cause a number of things, but most importantly it almost forces an opposing team to play out of their body. The Rockets switch everything, but being an undersized team, there are mismatches that present themselves on the floor or at least ones you think exist.

One of the reasons why the 2018 Western Conference Finals was so intriguing was Houston’s ability to almost force the Warriors into playing out of their nature. Where ball movement and cutting once reigned supreme, stagnation took its place. It became more isolation basketball and advantage-seeking.

The Thunder may not possess talents like Kevin Durant and Steph Curry, but they basically played right into the Rockets’ hands. Houston’s constant switching threw Oklahoma City off—as their 13 turnovers should indicate, with Houston earning 19 points off of. The ball movement and player movement ceased and came to a grinding halt. One of the Thunder’s hallmarks of the season had been their ball penetration from their guards, but Houston was able to shut that valve off. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Dennis Schroeder, two players that had been critical in the Thunder’s regular-season wins over Houston were effectively rendered useless.

At times, Houston’s defense looked like a zone, with each man almost accounting for a man and a half. But that’s only a mirage. It was particularly effective when the Rockets employed scram switching, a tactic used by switching defenses to negate would-be post mismatches.

I'm not sure if you can hear it, but it was pretty loud when I saw this clip. You can hear the Rockets talking on defense in particular Covington yelling for Rivers to get out and he sprints to the corner. pic.twitter.com/LFj994TSQ8

“Well actually, it looks like a zone,” D’Antoni said. “That’s one of our mottos: make it look like a zone because it isn’t. Switching man to man, but it should look like a zone. They did a good job with that and we just gotta continue to see where the weak spots, get them better. And they’re really good—one of the things about being like that, they’re smart. We try to take away any pick and roll plays or anything that may cause a problem. It’s all one-on-one problems. We did a pretty good job of guarding one-on-one tonight.”

An aggressive defense usually accounts for opposing teams that move constantly. When that’s nonexistent, you’re only making the defending team’s job easier. The Rockets were able to stop the Thunder’s attempts to generate some offensive rhythm in part because the Thunder partially stopped themselves.

Now, this isn’t to say the Rockets played an unbelievable defensive game from start to finish. The Thunder are a competent team and were able to get going in some areas, particularly from the outside. Danillo Gallinari accounts for the majority of that damage, scoring 29 points in a number of ways from all three levels on the floor, but overall the Thunder made 13 triples. At times, Steven Adams was able to effectively seal whichever Rocket was buried below and get easy putbacks. But this was a game Houston needed to win for various reasons and they were able to get it done.

“Just off the top of my head we gave Chris two open looks just dribble shots that he hit in front of our bench,” Harden said. “We can be better with our boxing out. Obviously Steven Adams is a big guy. He’s really good offensively, as far as rebounding. So we got to help with that. Dribble penetration. Knowing who’s on the floor when they have five guys on the floor. Like you said we’ll watch film and we’ll get better at it and Game 2 we have to be even better at it than we were in Game 1.”

“There are some areas we can get better at,” D’Antoni added. “Our defense was very good. We could have done a little bit better job on the threes they just took right in our faces, make them drivers. Overall, it was great. I’m nitpicking right now but I think for a long period—I think 20, 22 minutes—it was super. They’re a good team so they’ll be periods where you just can’t stop them but overall was great, we just need to get better.”

When news broke of Westbrook’s quad injury that would keep him sidelined from the Rockets’ playoff opener, the question of help once again resurfaced.

There were serious concerns that the Thunder would be able to advance (and there still are, Houston isn’t out of the dark just yet) but the main reason for optimism was that Houston didn’t have enough help without Westbrook marauding the floor. Gordon’s rhythm level was yet to be determined having played just two games in the restart, and while the bench had looked promising, there was still the all-too-familiar possibility of regression to the mean of the regular season.

In Game 1, Gordon answered all of those questions and then some. Normally, with increased opportunities come increased chances for production but there’s also the chance a player’s efficiency drops. Gordon’s usage rate of 31.0 would tell you he had an increased role by a substantial amount than what he’s accustomed to—an amount on par with superstars in this league and his 17 field-goal attempts the most shots he’d taken since February 4 in Charlotte and the infamous 50-point game in Salt Lake City in January.

But Gordon was able to respond positively with the ball in his hands more often. Westbrook’s presence was obviously felt in the speed and athleticism department, but Gordon was able to recoup some of that value. At times, he looked like a running back going downhill, displaying his shiftiness and agility. He beat a Thunder defender to the rim more than once with his quirky crossover, finished nicely around the rim, and even was able to create shots for others with his gravity. Gordon finished with 21 points, 4 assists, and 3 rebounds.

“It’s fundamental,” D’Antoni said. “We have to have it. Eric played well but I think he’ll even play better. It goes without saying, with or without Russell, he’s an important piece that we have.”

“It’s all about playmaking,” Gordon added. “I’m going to continue to attack the rim, or even knock down a shot. That’s the great thing about my game, I can always attack the rim, and I can always penetrate and kick to someone else. I’m not really worried about what I need to do. I just have to continue to [make plays] and make the right decisions.”

Emptying the notebook

1. I thought the ball movement tonight was excellent. Houston didn’t look to force the issue offensively, swinging the ball around until the right shot was found. Of the 16 teams that have played a playoff game so far, the Rockets ranked fifth in assists (25). Harden only finished with three assists. The effort was shared between guys like House (5 assists), Tucker (4 assists), Covington (3 assists), Gordon (4 assists), and Green (4 assists). Certainly an aspect of their game to watch moving forward, this was a job-by-committee to replicate Westbrook’s playmaking and the team passed with flying colors.

2. “Our ball movement tonight was excellent,” Harden said. “I think we were just playing off the catch. Guys were just very confident in their shot when open and when not open, getting off the ball and making the quick decision. I think we had a lot of shot opportunities that we missed that were really good shots. We did a really good job of not turning the basketball over which would’ve given them opportunities to get out in transition.”

3. Didn’t touch much on Harden’s game earlier, but he was at his best in Game 1. 37 points, 11 rebounds, six triples, and played 34 minutes. There was cause for concern when he stayed in the first quarter for all but the final two minutes, but D’Antoni was able to manage his load. With games coming every other day, that’s crucial. The Thunder used single coverage on him for the majority of the game (bad idea), which I’d expect to be tweaked going forward.

Houston’s defense gave fire to Harden’s offense, which was scintillating for the most part. I consider myself to be a pretty observatory person and I’d never seen him jumping rope before a game, but you could tell there was a pep in his step. He looked engaged on both ends of the floor. Every stepback 3 is more demoralizing than the last and the Thunder received steady doses of that.

4. Houston’s 2nd unit came to play, with McLemore and Green combining for 36 points.

“It’s good, plus when Russ gets back, we’ll have an even deeper bench,” D’Antoni said. “Ben’s been playing well only since the first of the year. You got Jeff and Austin, our bench is good. It’s just trying to get everyone healthy and playing at the same time.”

McLemore looked sharp in his first-ever playoff action, hitting 4 triples, and Green continued his strong play in the bubble. He brings a different look offensively for Houston without a traditional big and is able to do so much with the ball. At times, Green brought the ball up himself and was able to initiate the offense, a huge plus for Harden who can catch a breather every now and then, play off-ball, act as a screener, et cetera.

“We’re just trying to put the defense on their heels, giving them a different look,” Green said. “We know that all the focus is going to be on James, so it’s just another opportunity for us to take the pressure off him with Russell out… for everybody to get involved.”

5. I was thoroughly impressed with the production the team got in the non-Harden minutes. In the 14 minutes Harden sat, the Rockets posted an offensive rating of 114.8 and a defensive rating of 92.9 (!). A +22 in the playoffs, while your superstar sits, is stellar. Houston also didn’t get obliterated on the boards (losing 46-36) or in the 2nd-chance points (11-8), two areas we discussed in our series preview as areas the Thunder weren’t particularly strong in. Credit McLemore (95.7 D-Rtg), Green (97.0), and Rivers (92.1) for not allowing for a dropoff.

6. An interesting stat: With Harden on the floor, the Rockets played at a 98.2 pace. With him off the floor, it dropped even more (95.2). I’m sure during the film session, D’Antoni will call for an uptick in pace because it almost adds another layer of uncomfortability to the Thunder’s plate.

7. At some point, Robert Covington’s going to have to break out of this shooting slump, right? Houston got enough production elsewhere to get by, but you can’t count on that every game, especially in the playoffs. Elsewhere, I thought his defense was tremendous. I think he plays with four hands instead of two, there’s no reason why he should get that many deflections, tipped passes and almost-steals. 

8. “I don’t know if it played into their hands,” said D’Antoni on defensively imposing their presence. “They play the way they play like we [do]. But we were good tonight. It’s a long series, they’ll make their adjustments and we gotta be ready to play with the same intensity all the way through. But tonight was a good night and we’ll start from zero on Thursday night.”
